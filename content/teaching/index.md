### Teaching Experience

I've had the privilege of teaching in numerous settings with all different types of students. 

In Summer 2014, I volunteered with [Coach for College](https://www.coachforcollege.org/) teaching physics and coaching volleyball to 7th and 8th graders in rural Vietnam. Working with college student volunteers as translators, this was an incredible experience  creating hands-on activities and engaging lesson plans. 

In Fall 2016 and Summer 2017, I taught Calculus 1 and College Algebra at Miami Dade College in Miami, FL. 

In Fall 2017, I was a teaching assistant for [STA101: Data Analysis and Statistics](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall17/sta101.001/). I taught a once-weekly interactive lab section, leading lessons such as [this lab](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/sampling_distributions/) on sample distributions. 

In Fall 2018, I was the teaching assistant for [BIOSTAT702: Introduction to Applied Biostatistics](./syllabus702.pdf). In Spring 2019, I was the teaching assistant for BIOSTAT703: Introduction to the Practice of Biostatistics. These were first-year courses for the Master of Biostatistics program at Duke. 

In the 2021-2022 academic year, I received an NSF-funded fellowship to work with the Integrative Bioinformatics for [Investigating and Engineering Microbiomes (IBIEM)](https://ibiem.pratt.duke.edu/) program as a teaching assistant. In this role, I provided computational support to students in the program (both Master's and doctoral) for using the DADA2 pipeline to analyze microbiome data, specifically focusing on reproducible research and version-control.
