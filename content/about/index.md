### About Me

I'm a biostatistics PhD student at Duke University studying health disparities, social determinants of health, and statistical pedagogy. 
Outside of my research, I am interested in data visualization, teaching, and science communication. 

Growing up in Austin, TX, I attended Liberal Arts and Science Academy High School. I was enrolled in the magnet program which placed a strong emphasis on math and science. While there, I had some incredible math teachers who taught me how to make a mental map of problem solving. 

When choosing a university, I didn't have a clear idea where I wanted to go nor what I wanted to study. After receiving a scholarship to be on the diving team, I decided on University of Miami. Remembering my love for math, I chose this subject as a major alongside minors in psychology and film. As my undergraduate studies came to a close, I began to get interested in the idea of teaching as a career. What if I could teach others how to be comfortable with math the way my teachers did growing up? I completed my Master of Arts degree in mathematics and began teaching at Miami Dade Community College. This was an incredibly rewarding experience, especially working with students from such diverse backgrounds. 

Towards the end of my master's, I expressed to one of my professors wanting to continue my education through a more applied discipline, while still drawing from my math background. He suggested biostatistics as a great way to bring the two things together. So, I applied for PhD programs. Six years later, I am nearing completion of my dissertation and looking forward to begin my teaching career.
